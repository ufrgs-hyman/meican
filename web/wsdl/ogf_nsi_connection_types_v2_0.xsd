            This is an XML schema document describing the OGF NSI Connection
            Services protocol version 2.0. The Connection Service is message
            based command protocol that operates between a Requester
            Network Service Agent (NSA) and a Provider NSA. The protocol includes
            a set of defined primitives that are intended to provide the control
            necessary to manage the lifecycle of a connection reservation.
            
            The following primitives are supported in this version of the NSI CS
            protocol:
            
            1. Reserve - Make a request to reserve network resources for a
            connection between two STP's constrained by a certain service
            parameters or request a modification of an existing reservation.
            Any required resources will be pre-allocated and held until
            the commit of this reserve is received.
            
            3. ReserveCommit - Commit a previously allocated reservation
            or modification on a reservation.
            
            4. ReserveAbort - Cancel a pending reservation or modification
            and release any associated resources.
            
            5. Provision - Provider NSA has been given permission to setup a
            reservation (associated with a previous reserve message) on
            the Requester NSA's behalf but subject to the constraints of
            the requested service.
            
            6. Release - Provider NSA should release the provisioned resources
            without removing the reservation.
            
            7. Terminate - Provider NSA should release the provisioned resources
            and terminate the reservation.
            
            8. QuerySummary - Mechanism for either NSA to query the other NSA
            for a set of connection service instances between the RA-PA pair.
            The returned results will be a summary of the reservation
            information.
            
            9. QuerySummarySync - Mechanism for a requester NSA to query the
            provider NSA for a set of connection service instances between the
            RA-PA pair. The returned results will be a summary of the
            reservation information.  This is a synchronous blocking operation
            and not asynchronous like QuerySummary and QueryRecursive.
            
            10. QueryRecursive - Mechanism for either NSA to query the other
            NSA for a set of connection service instances between the RA-PA
            pair. The returned results will be a detailed list of reservation
            information collected by recursively traversing the reservation
            tree.

            11. QueryNotification - Mechanism for a requester NSA to query the
            provider NSA for a set of notifications against a connectionId.  The
            returned results will be a list of notifications for the specified
            connectionId.

            12. QueryNotificationSync - Mechanism for a requester NSA to query the
            provider NSA for a set of notifications against a connectionId.  The
            returned results will be a list of notifications for the specified
            connectionId.  This is a synchronous blocking operation.
            
            13. queryResult - Mechanism for a requester NSA to query the
            provider NSA for a set of operation results (Confirmed, Failed, Error)
            against a connectionId. A list of previous results for the specified
            connectionId will be returned.
            
            14. queryResultSync - Mechanism for a requester NSA to query the
            provider NSA for a set of operation results (Confirmed, Failed, Error)
            against a connectionId. A list of previous results for the specified
            connectionId will be returned.  This is a synchronous blocking
            operation.           
            
            In addition, there are four notification primitives:
            
            1. errorEvent - An autonomous message issued from a Provider NSA to
            a Requester NSA when an existing reservation encounters an
            autonomous error condition such as being administratively terminated
            before the reservation's scheduled end-time.
            
            2. reserveTimeout -An autonomous message issued from a Provider NSA to
            a Requester NSA when a timeout on an existing reserve request occurs
            and uncommitted resources have been freed.
            
            3. dataPlaneStateChange - An autonomous message issued from a Provider
            NSA to a Requester NSA when a data plane state change event has occurred
            within the network.
            
            4. messageDeliveryTimeout - Notification message for a message
            transport layer delivery timeout of an NSI CS request message.
            In the event of an MTL or Coordinator timeout, the Coordinator
            will generate this message delivery failure notification and
            send it up the workflow tree (towards the uRA).
            
            If the uRA wants to request a resend of the the original message
            it must issue the original operation again with the same
            correlationId. Aggregators receiving the request SHOULD only
            attempt redelivery of the message to children that it did not
            receive an acknowledgement for (i.e. MTL timeout) or reply to
            (i.e. Coordinator timeout) the original message.
            
            The Connection Service protocol is an asynchronous protocol where
            each primitive may consist of four operations:
            
            1. Request - A Requester NSA issues an operation request message
            such as "reserve" to the Provider NSA. The Requester NSA can
            expect an response to the request at some point in the future.
            
            2. Response - A Provider NSA may issue an immediate response
            to the Requester NSA providing needed progress information.
            For example, a requester NSA issuing a "reserve" request can
            expect a "reserveResponse" message providing the connectionId
            needed for querying reservation progress.
            
            3. Confirmed - A Provider NSA sends this positive operation
            response message (such as "reserveConfirmed") to the Requester
            NSA that issued the original request message ("reserveRequest").
            
            4. Failed - A Provider NSA sends this negative operation response
            message (such as "reserveFailed") to the Requester NSA that
            issued the original request message ("reserveRequest").

                The NSI CS reserve message allows a RA to reserve network
                resources associated with a service within the Network
                constrained by the provided service parameters.  This operation
                allows a Requester NSA to check the feasibility of connection
                reservation or a modification to an existing reservation. Any
                resources associated with the reservation or modification will

                after the confirm/fail for the request has been returned
                to the Requesting NSA.

                The PSM transits states independent of the state of the
                Reservation State Machine. Note that staying at the Provisioned
                state is necessary but not sufficient to activate the data plane.
                The data plane is active if the PSM is in “Provisioned” state
                AND current_time is between startTime and endTime.
                
                Possible state values are:
                
                Released – A steady state for the provision state machine in which data
                plane resources for this reservation are in a released state, resulting
                in an inactive data plane.
                
                Provisioning - A transient state modelling the act of provisioning the
                reservation’s associated data plane resources.
                
                Provisioned - A steady state for the provision state machine in which
                data plane resources for this reservation are in a provisioned state.
                This state does not imply that data plane resources are active, but it
                does indicate that a uPA can active the data plane resources if
                current_time is between startTime and endTime.
                
                Releasing - A transient state modelling the act of releasing the
                reservation’s associated data plane resources.

                Connection lifecycle state values for the reservation lifecycle
                state machine.  The lifecycle state machine is instantiated when
                a reservation is committed.  Possible state values are:
                
                Created – A steady state for the lifecycle state machine and the
                initial state after a reservation has been committed.
                
                Failed – A steady state for the lifecycle state machine that is
                reached if a forcedEnd error is received from a uPA.
                
                PassedEndTime - The reservation has exceeded scheduled end time.
                
                Terminating - A transient state modelling the act of terminating
                the reservation.
                
                Terminated - A steady state for the lifecycle state machine that
                is reached when the reservation is terminated by the uRA.
