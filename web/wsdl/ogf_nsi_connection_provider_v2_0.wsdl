    Open Grid Forum NSI Connection Services Protocol v2.0

    Description: This is the NSI Connection Services Protocol 2.0 service definitions for the reference web services implementation of the OGF NSI Connection Services Protocol v2.0. Comments and questions can be directed to the mailing list group mailing list (nsi-wg@ogf.org).

    This document is the SOAP endpoint definition for a provider NSA.  It holds definitions for messages the provider NSA will receive.  For the reserve, provision, release, and terminate message sets the provider will receive request messages only.  For the query operation a provider NSA must support request, confirmed, and failed messages due to the possibility that a provider NSA may query the requester for a list of connection reservations.
