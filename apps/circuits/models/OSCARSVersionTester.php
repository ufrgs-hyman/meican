* - Simple class used to elevate the level of OSCARS version inspection. This class has one method which returns an object of type OSCARSDriver05 or 
*   OSCARSDriver06 as appropriate to the OSCARS version in use. 
* - This functionality was originally encapsulated as part of the OSCARSReservation class, but since that class has been decomposed into the Driver 
*   classes, the version test has to come before instantiating a concrete driver.
