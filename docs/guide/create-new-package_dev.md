### 1- Choose the settings for the image that will be generated: :mag:

  * The version of MEICAN you want to build.

  * A name for the image that will be created.

<div>&nbsp&nbsp :warning: Support for this functionality exists as of version 3.4.0.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp :warning: In the following commands, <b><em>3.4.0</em></b> will be used as the chosen version and <b><em>ghcr.io/ufrgs-hyman/meican/meican-app:3.4.0</em></b> will be used as the chosen image name. 
When you go to create an image, don't forget to change these values to the ones of your choice.<div>

### 2- Build the MEICAN image: :gear:
  * Go to 'docker_for_build' directory.
  * Run: ```docker build --build-arg MEICAN_VERSION=3.4.0 -t ghcr.io/ufrgs-hyman/meican/meican-app:3.4.0 .```

<div>&nbsp&nbsp :warning: Note that there is a dot at the end of the command.</div>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp :triangular_flag_on_post:After running, the image will be created on your local machine.</div>
